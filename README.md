# ðŸ“Š R Programming â€“ Data Analysis & Machine Learning

This repository contains my personal journey into the **R programming language**, which I studied independently out of curiosity and passion for **data processing** and **machine learning**.

## ðŸ§  Why R?

I chose to explore R because it is a powerful language designed specifically for **statistical computing**, **data manipulation**, and **visualization** â€” three essential pillars in modern data science.

## ðŸ“š What I've Learned

During this self-study, Iâ€™ve explored and practiced a wide range of R features and concepts, including:

### ðŸ”§ Core Language Features
- Basic functions: `sum()`, `prod()`, `min()`, `max()`, `mean()`, `length()`, `sort()`
- Control structures: `for`, `if`
- Creating custom functions
- Working with `factor`, `list`, `matrix`

### ðŸ“‚ Data Handling
- Reading and processing data from `.csv` files
- Creating and manipulating `data.frame` objects
- Cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis

### ðŸ“ˆ Visualization & Graphs
- Creating various types of plots to explore data
- Using base R plotting functions and other visualization tools

### ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Applications
I also experimented with applying basic machine learning algorithms on real datasets, such as:
- **Decision Trees**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**

These experiments allowed me to better understand both the algorithms and the R syntax used to implement them.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **RStudio**: My main development environment, offering great tools for code editing, visualization, and version control integration.

## ðŸŒŸ Final Thoughts

This project represents an important step in my journey as a data enthusiast. It helped me build a solid foundation in R and develop practical skills in data analysis and modeling.

Whether you're a beginner exploring R or someone interested in simple machine learning projects, I hope this repository will be helpful or inspiring.
